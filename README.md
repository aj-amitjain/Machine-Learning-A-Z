# Machine-Learning-A-Z

### This is a repository with sample examples and dataset from the course "Machine Learning A-Z" by Udemy.

### This is an amazing course to start with to learn data science in both Python & R, this repository only has few files where I have combined all the code in a section in both Python and R, like all the regression model or all the classification model in one file so that its easy to compare and remember the difference. 

### Note: As it's just a start you may not find all the file I intend to put. So, Be patient.  


### It is important to mention the instructor here as it's all their hard work. 

## Instructor :
  ### Kirill Eremenko
